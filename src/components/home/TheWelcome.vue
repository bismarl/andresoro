      Led by researcher Francis Bordeleau and industry partners Kaloom and TELUS, the Kaloom-TELUS
      Chair is based on new DevOps engineering approaches and will help entrepreneurs design new IT
      services 100 times faster than traditional methods. This allows them to react more quickly to
      the competitive environment, which is currently marked by labour shortages.

      The DevOps methodology aims to optimize the workflow by creating value for the end user, from
      the initial idea to the deployment of the functionality. It reduces unnecessary tasks,
      accelerates the time to market for products and services, and increases their quality. It also
      builds on the collaboration between the various parties involved in the development of
      reliable, high-performance products.
